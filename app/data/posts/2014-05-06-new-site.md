title: "Rails Girls Switzerland has a new face!"
---
We are happy to announce that we were finally able to rework the official Rails Girls Switzerland page!

On here you'll find all informations about past and upcoming Rails Girls events. In addition we want to extend the site with further content including:

- A list of local meet-up groups, where you can find like-minded people that can help you get into programming.
- A company index, listing all tech companies in Switzerland that offer Internships / Jobs.
- Additional resources and additional help from coaches outside the workshop.

If you would like to help us out or provide feedback then [contact us](mailto:contact@railsgirls.ch). We'd love to hear from you!

Hugs,   
Daniel, Muriel & Rodrigo
